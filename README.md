## normalize-vector
A program to calculate a 3D normalized vector.
<p> If you are a 42 student making the miniRT project, you can use it to help get easly some normalized oriented vector values during the project evaluation or to help create some cool scenes.

### Run
- `git clone https://github.com/sgkhusal/normalize-vector.git`
- `cd normalize-vector`
- `make`
- `./normalize x y z`

x, y and z can be decimal numbers, eg: `./normalize -1 1.5 0.125`
